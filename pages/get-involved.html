        <p>It all starts with your choice to act instead of looking away. By acknowledging and then addressing the
            pervasive problem of food insecurity, you start a chain reaction. Struggling families gain the support that
            they need, granting them a chance at a more promising future, where they in turn can help those still in
            need. Your action has the power to transform a life, a family, a community, and a nation.</p>
